               Hi, I'm Jared, a UCLA freshman born and raised in Los Angeles, California 
          (No, I don't see celebrities everyday). My humble journey as a programmer 
          began my sophomore year of high school where I wrote my first program with 
          Scratch, a language widely used by eight year olds learning to code. Since 
          then, my skills have matured to include more advanced languages that are all 
          listed in my resume (I didn't want to bore you here by naming them all). 
               When I'm not staring at my computer screen, you can find me practicing calisthenics 
          tricks at Drake Stadium, lifeguarding at the UCLA pools, or going out for late 
          night food runs. Scroll further down to see more about me!

          I'm a part of the Bruin Street Workout Club at UCLA. 
          We meet weekly at Drake Stadium to work out and practice 
          calisthenics tricks. Our club also participates in competitions 
          against other schools' calisthenics clubs. Right now, I'm training 
          to do a handstand push up and eventually a one arm handstand.

        I started working as a lifeguard my freshman year of college. I’ve 
        always been used to being in the water from playing water polo and 
        swimming all of high school. As a lifeguard, I’m CPR/AED certified 
        and trained in First Aid. I mainly work for UCLA Rercreation and Aquatics, 
        but I also do private lifeguarding with Happy Swimmers USA.
